## [Consulting](/consulting.html)
I'm $85 an hour if I come to you. If that burns too much and you still need expert advice I am $20 for a quick visit if you come to me. I will get you through your immediate problem and off again in the right direction. From Idea to complex web application, I've been right where you are and I can help you get to where you want to be.

## [Blog](/blog.html)
Where I remind the tech community about it's roots in the counter culture and I think about what the costs are for abondoning our way.
