## Realness

Realness is a social network that's more like a tool than a popularity contest. It uses your phone number, so you get built-in messaging and group text.  All of your information stays on your phone. We don't even know who your friends are. What is shared on the network are your posts and a simple profile for people to find you.

### What you can do with Realness
- You sign up with your phone number
- You can post updates
- You can take a selfie and create an avatar
- You can look for people you may know on Realness
- You can add those people  
- You can view a feed of what those people want to say

There are no likes. There are no friend counts. There are no comments. You text your friends directly when they post something that moves you.

### What I know about Realness from using it
- I post less
- What I do post is genuine
- I check it less
- I text when I relate to what's in my feed
- I feel connected
