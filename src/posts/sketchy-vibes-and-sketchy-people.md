They beat me until I was sixteen. Thats until this this dude who was a lieutenant in the army in Vietnam, a tunnel rat, he stepped in. That was what it was gonna take. My dad was a Marine in the late fifties early sixties, and it worked. I can't think about that tunnel rat without wanting to cry in gratitude.

After I was twelve the beatings were senseless. They were brutal before, but at least they were predictable. My dad was in a rage my whole childhood, but from twelve to sixteen it was something worse – a sickness.

So much violence.

Seventeen and eighteen was mostly verbal shit. You know, the names that people who beat you get to use. Your nothingness in word form. Dug in so deep.

And I got to where you are family money. I walked my own path. took my brain seriously and worked my ass off to get in the room with you. I see the us in them family money. We can't leave them all behind.

Don't you get it? You can't put someone who is like this in the loser box. I see shit you don't, I worked, put in twenty years of therapy. Dug so deep.

I have to sit every day and work with the rage my dad put inside me. It's what I have to do to get to the good shit, the soft brain, willing, open, subtle.

I can come too engineering with a gentle mind, every day, rain or shine. I had to do more than homework to get here.

Being honest to myself because a lie becomes an excuse which is all the space anger needs. I had to learn that the hard way; how ugly it is to lie to ones self.

I can relate to people that make you uncomfortable. Social media is getting this so utterly wrong. You guys, you commodified intimacy. You made the artificial more important than the real. The artificial will be brutal; a numb world always is.

I raised a daughter. When she was young I knew it wouldn't fly. That I couldn't do to her what was done to me. I knew I had to eat it. I knew that it was my job to pass on love and discipline; to raise a fearless child.

I know how wrong you are when you allow yourself to be afraid of sketchy vibes.
