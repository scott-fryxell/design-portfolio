## consulting

On my first day with you I can deliver an industry leading software development environment and put an app on your phone so that we can begin to R&D your problem. We will build your app together in real time.

I am a full stack web application engineer. The bulk of my career has been spent working with startups.  I have been immersed in software development, the arts, and counterculture for 20+ years, and am successful in technology because I execute. I have learned over and over again that to be productive is to be open and honest. 

With this perspective, I offer authenticity and a highly creative environment for the people that I work with to explore problems and make decisions. I am looking to work with people who like to focus on elegant solutions executed to the highest possible standards.

I have mentored, hired and built long lasting teams with minimal resources. My soft skills are highly developed and I can connect closely with diverse purpose driven organizations.

I have done the hard work and have the experience to get you up and running quickly and keep you current and productive years into the future.
