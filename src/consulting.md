## consulting
I am a full stack web application engineer. The bulk of my career has been spent working with startups.  I have been immersed in software development, the arts, and counterculture for 20+ years, and am successful in technology because I execute.

With this perspective, I offer authenticity and a highly creative environment for the people that I work with to explore problems and make decisions. I am looking to work with people who like to focus on elegant solutions executed to the highest possible standards.

I have mentored, hired and built long lasting teams with minimal resources. My soft skills are highly developed and I can connect closely with diverse purpose driven organizations.

I have spent the last 2 years going slow building out an ideal development enviroment most developers long to work in.

On my first day with you I can deliver a Industry leading software development enviroment that will keep your current and productive year into the future.
