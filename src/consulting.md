## consulting
I am a full stack web application engineer. The bulk of my career has been spent working with startups.  I have been immersed in software development, the arts, and counterculture for 20 years, and am successful in technology because I execute.

With this perspective, I offer authenticity and a highly creative environment for the people that I work with to explore problems and make decisions. I am looking for a team focused on elegant solutions executed to the highest possible standards.

I have mentored, hired and built long lasting teams with minimal resources. My soft skills are highly developed and I can connect closely with diverse purpose driven organizations.
